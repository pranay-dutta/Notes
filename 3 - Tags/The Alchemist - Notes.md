>"Reading The Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept" - *HarperCollins* ~ **American Publisher**

**Obstacles**
1. We were told in childhood *"Everything we want to do is impossible"*
2. We know what we want to do but *"We are scared to hurt people around us"*
3. Fear of losing & We can't say *"Oh well, I didn't really want it anyway"
4. Self doubt *"We think we aren't capable of receiving something that someone failed to achieve"*
