There is nothing that is beyond universe or something like that.
Simple example: you have a rubber which goes till infinity ♾️ and every ***inch*** has a ***mark*** on it. now if the rubber ***stretches***  and every ***mark*** became ***2 inch*** far still the rubber goes to infinity.

## Universe is like that it does not need more space to expand. It just stretches and also bends.


##### Physicists think of "**space**" not as emptiness, but similar to a piece of rubber. (But they don't call it rubber; they call it the "***vacuum***"
