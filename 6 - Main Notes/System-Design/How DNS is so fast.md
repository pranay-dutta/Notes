How DNS is So Fast (Even with Millions of Domains)
--------------------------------------------

1. DNS Caching (Most important!)
--------------------------------------------
- DNS results are stored in cache at many levels:
  - Browser cache
  - Operating System (OS) cache
  - Router cache
  - ISP (Internet Service Provider) cache
  - CDN (like Cloudflare) cache
  - Once a domain is resolved, repeated lookups are instant.

2. Globally Distributed DNS Servers
--------------------------------------------
- DNS providers (like Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS) have servers worldwide.
- Your query is answered by the **nearest** server.

3. Efficient DNS Hierarchy
--------------------------------------------
- DNS lookup follows an optimized path:
  - Root servers
  - TLD servers (.com, .org, etc.)
  - Authoritative name servers
  - Due to caching, most queries don't go through the full path. 

4. Load Balancing & Redundancy
--------------------------------------------
- DNS systems are built to handle large traffic with load balancing.
- Multiple redundant servers ensure no delay or downtime.

5. Fast Recursive Resolvers
--------------------------------------------
- Recursive resolvers (like 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8) are optimized for low-latency responses.
- They often respond in just a few milliseconds.

--------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
--------------------------------------------
Even with billions of domains, DNS feels instant because:
✅ Most queries are served from cache  
✅ Servers are close to you (low latency)  
✅ The system is highly optimized for performance
