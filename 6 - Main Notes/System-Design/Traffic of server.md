**Topic**: [[System Design]] [[Computer Network]]

ðŸ“Œ**Server traffic** refers to the amount of data sent to and from a server over a network within a given time. It includes:

- **Incoming traffic**: Requests from users or other systems (e.g., visiting a website).
- **Outgoing traffic**: Responses sent by the server (e.g., delivering a webpage or API result).

High traffic can affect **performance, speed, and availability**, so servers need to be scaled or optimized using [[Horizontal Scaling]] or [[Vertical Scaling]] to handle heavy loads effectively
