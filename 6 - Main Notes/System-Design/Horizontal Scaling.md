**Topic**: [[System Design]] 
## ðŸ“ŒAlso known as scale-out


**ðŸ˜²Horizontal Scaling** and [[Sharding]] are related concepts, but they are not exactly the same thing. 

ðŸ“Œ**Horizontal Scaling** means increasing system capacity by adding more machines or nodes. 
These machines share the workloadâ€”often as replicasâ€”allowing the system to handle more traffic.

*Horizontal scaling is a general term that can be applied to various architectures and systems.*
