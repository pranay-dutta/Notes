1. You type a domain in the browser.
2. The request goes to a DNS resolver.
3. The resolver queries Root, TLD, and Authoritative servers.
4. The IP address is returned, and your browser connects to the site.

Key Components:
----------------------------
- **DNS Resolver**            : Takes your query and starts the lookup.
- **Root Server**               : First step in translating domain names.
- **TLD Server**                 : Handles extensions like .com, .org.
- **Authoritative Server**  : Holds the actual IP info for the domain.
