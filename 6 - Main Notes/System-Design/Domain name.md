ðŸ“Œ A **domain name** is a string of text that maps to an **alphanumeric** [[IP Address]], used to access a website from **client software**.

> In plain English, a domain name is the text that the user types in to a browser window to reach a particular website.

**Example:** pranay-dutta.vercel.app, google.com

---
The actual address of a website is a **complex numerical IP address (e.g. 192.0.2.2)**, but thanks to [[DNS]], 
users are able to enter **human-friendly domain** names and be routed to the website they are looking for.
**This process is known as DNS lookup****
