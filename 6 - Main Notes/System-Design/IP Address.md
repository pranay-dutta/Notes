ðŸ“ŒAn **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to every device connected to a **computer network** that uses the Internet Protocol. It serves two main purposes:

1. **Identification** â€“ identifies the host or network interface.
2. **Location addressing** â€“ helps route data between devices.

There are two versions:

- **IPv4** â€“ e.g., `192.168.1.1`
- **IPv6** â€“ e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334` (used as IPv4 addresses run out)
