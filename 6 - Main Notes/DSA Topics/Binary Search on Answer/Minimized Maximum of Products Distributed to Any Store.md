`Problem:`
You are given an integerÂ `n`Â indicating there areÂ `n`Â specialty retail stores. There areÂ `m`Â product types of varying amounts,
which are given as aÂ **0-indexed**Â integer arrayÂ `quantities`, whereÂ `quantities[i]`Â represents the number of products of theÂ `ith`Â product type.

You need to distributeÂ **all products**Â to the retail stores following these rules:

- A store can only be givenÂ **at most one product type**Â but can be givenÂ **any**Â amount of it.
- After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possiblyÂ `0`). 
  LetÂ `x`Â represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You wantÂ `x`Â to be as small as possible, i.e., 
  you want toÂ **minimize**Â theÂ **maximum**Â number of products that are given to any store.
ReturnÂ _the minimum possible_Â `x`.

==reduce the product given to each store such that all stores receives a type of product ==
