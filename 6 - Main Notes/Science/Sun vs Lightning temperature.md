### Sun's surface Temperature
***10,000° F (5,500°C)****

*The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top **27 million °F (15 million °C).** 
The part of the Sun we call its surface – **[[The photosphere]]** – is a relatively cool **10,000° F (5,500°C)***


### Temperature of  Lightning
 ***28,000–30,000°C (50,000–54,000°F)***

*The average length of a lightning bolt is about 2-3 miles. The charge carried down this small channel is so intense 
that the temperature of the lightning reaches **30,000 °C** - that's five times hotter than the surface of the Sun.*
