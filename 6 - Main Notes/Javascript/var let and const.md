What is this var, let and const 
- These are reserved keywords to create a variable.

There are 3 ways to declare but they differ in scope and **Hoisting** behavior, and re-assignment rules.

- **var:** Declares variables with **function** or **global scope** and allows **re-declaration** and **updates** with the same scope.
- **let:** Declares variables with **block** scope, allowing updates but **not re-declaration** within the same block.
- **const:** Declares **block-scoped** variables that cannot be **reassigned** after their **initial assignment**
