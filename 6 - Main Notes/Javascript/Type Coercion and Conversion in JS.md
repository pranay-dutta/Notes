ðŸ“ŒData types in **JavaScript** are flexible due to which the type of the **variable** can be change when the program runs.  **Type Conversion** and **Type Coercion** are two ways through which we *can change the data type* of the **variables** from one type to the other.

## Type Conversion

Type Conversion is the process in **JavaScript** in which the data type of the variables is **converted from one type to another type manually**. This is also known as **explicit type casting**.

- Performed manually by the programmer
- Uses built-in JavaScript methods like *Number(), String(), and Boolean()*
- Ensures control over data type in code
