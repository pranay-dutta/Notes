## 📘 Square Root Tricks & Memorization

### 🧠 How to Know If a Number is a Perfect Square

#### ✅ Quick Tests:

- ✔ Ends in **0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9** (❌ Never ends in 2, 3, 7, 8)
    
- ✔ Digital Root ∈ {**1, 4, 7, 9**}
    
- ✔ Prime factorization: All primes have **even powers**
    
- ✔ If ends in **25**, square root ends in **5**
    
- ✔ If ends in **6**, the tens digit must be even

### 🧠 How to Memorize Perfect Squares Easily

#### 🎯 Memorize from $0^2$ to $9^2$

```ts
//-------------------   Last Digit of Square
0*0 = 0^2 = 0                     0
1*1 = 1^2 = 1                     1 -----------------
2*2 = 2^2 = 4                     4 --------------
3*3 = 3^2 = 9                     9 ------------
4*4 = 4^2 = 16                    6 --------
5*5 = 5^2 = 25                    5
6*6 = 6^2 = 36                    6
7*7 = 7^2 = 49                    9 ------------
8*8 = 8^2 = 64                    4 --------------
9*9 = 9^2 = 81                    1 -----------------
```

### 🔁 Square Pattern Formula

 $(n + 1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1$

Use this to build squares mentally:

🧮 Example:

172=289⇒182=289+2×17+1=289+34+1=32417^2 = 289 \Rightarrow 18^2 = 289 + 2×17 + 1 = 289 + 34 + 1 = 324172=289⇒182=289+2×17+1=289+34+1=324

⏫ You can do the reverse too:

(n−1)2=n2−2n+1(n - 1)^2 = n^2 - 2n + 1(n−1)2=n2−2n+1

### 🎓 Tricks to Find √(Perfect Square)

#### 📌 1. Check the **last digit**

- If a square ends in **9**, root ends in **3 or 7**
    
- If ends in **6**, root ends in **4 or 6**
    
- If ends in **5**, root must end in **5**
    
- If ends in **1**, root ends in **1 or 9**
    
- If ends in **4**, root ends in **2 or 8**
    

#### 📌 2. Use range estimation:

- Between n2n^2n2 and (n+1)2(n+1)^2(n+1)2$, guess the root
    

Example:

csharp

CopyEdit

`√289 → ends in 9 → try 13 or 17 2 is before 89 → try 17² = 289 ✅`

### 🧠 Tips to Practice

- Use flashcards: One side `169`, other side `13²`
    
- Mental math: Use the formula to go up/down from known squares
    
- Practice reverse estimation (guess the root from a number)
