 ðŸ“ŒSuppose **N** is near **âˆž** infinity. 
*In Geometric Progression sum (**S**) of infinite terms*

$$S = \frac{a}{1 - r}$$

---
*Where* -
- **S** = sum of the infinite GP
- **a** = first term
- **r** = common ratio (must satisfy $| \ r \ | < 1$)

***r** = second term / first term*
# Sum âˆž = $\frac{a}{1-r}$ = $\frac{N}{1-1/2}$ =$\frac{N}{0.5}$ = 2 * N
